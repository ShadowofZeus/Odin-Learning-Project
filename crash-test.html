          <h1>Hello Simz Let the Coding Begin!!!</h1>
          <p>For many years, I have wanted to create my own website
            using my own code and creativity. I now need to earn money for myself
            and get all the hands-on skills I can get and use to be paid.
            My journey begins.......

          <h1>My Inspiration to this end</h1>
          <p>Funny enough I didn't think of this earlier, I was stuck in a bubble
            just hoping that it wouldnt burst. But like any bubble, it bursted and hurt
            me bad. I did not have any hands-on IT skills to feed my family and yet I had a brain.
            People who were not as bright as me where the ones driving fancy cars and taking all the hot girls whilst
            I wanked in poverty.
